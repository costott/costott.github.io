			Therefore, a number of methods have to be implemented to speed up
			rendering, as a simple program running on 1 thread and iterating through

			weeks to months to render "deep" zooms. The different methods will be

			discussed first.

		<a href="#the-formula" class="heading" id="the-formula">The Formula</a>
		<p class="main-content">
			The rest of this post will focus on the Mandelbrot set formula in order to
			avoid switching between too many topics, but the same premise will apply
			to other iterative-formula based fractals.
			<br />
			The Mandelbrot set is rendered on the
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane" target="_blank"
				>complex plane</a
			>, where each pixel on the screen is representing a complex number in the
			form <b>x + iy</b>. The Mandelbrot formula is then applied to each point:
			<br /><b>z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</b><br />
			In this formula, z and c are complex numbers, where c is a constant. c is
			defined before the iterations begin; it is the complex number the point on
			the screen is representing. z starts at 0 + 0i, and we watch to see where
			it bounces around <b>(orbit)</b> after each iteration. If z explodes off
			to infinity it is outside the set, and if it stays contained it is inside
			the set. In order to see if z explodes to infinity, we check to see if |z|
			gets too big after a set number of iterations, as we can't run the
			iterations infinitely. As you zoom closer to the boundary of the fractal,
			more iterations are needed to determine whether z it escaped or not.

		<p class="main-content">
			The most simple optimisation is to do with checking when |z| diverges to
			infinity. It has been
			<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/424331" target="_blank"
				>proven</a
			>
			that whenever <b>|z| > 2</b>, the point will diverge to infinity, so
			simply stop iterating if the orbit reaches this as you have determined
			that it's outside the set. Keep in mind that formulas (such as orbit
			traps) work better / look different with greater bailot values (in this
			case the bailout is 2), but for the most part the bailout should be at or
			as close to 2 as possible.<br />
			<br />
			Following on from this, another potential simple change is to check if
			<b>|Re(z)| > 2</b> or <b>|Im(z)| > 2</b>, as these are much more simple to
			do than calculating <b>|z|</b> (which involves both squaring and a square
			root). Again, some formulas will look different depending on the shape of
			the bailout (this one is a square) as the orbit will be different, so
			while this is a potential fix for a simple escape-time colouring it can
			ruin the image for others. <br /><br />
			Another very simple change is to just use a fast programming language. I
			originally programmed a Mandelbrot visualiser in Python, which was
			extremely slow and would take over 15 seconds to render a single frame at
			20 maximum iterations. Even adding optimisations such as using NumPy for
			faster calculations and taichi for JIT compiling, it was still slow.
			Switching to Rust without any optimisations gave a program much faster
			than my Python approach, being able to render an image with 2000 maximum
			iterations in a matter of milliseconds. I then kept with Rust for the
			remainder of my

			can improve the speed of lots of programs, and fractal rendering is
			definitelty one of them. The most simple approach is to just split the
			screen into multiple sections and give them to threads (ideally in a
			thread pool) to be rendered in parallel. This will greatly reduce render
			times, and is one of the most important additions for fast renders.

			Screens have millions of pixels on them, meaning each image can take
			trillions to quadrillions (and so on) of iterations to render. Even with
			all the other optimisations mentioned in this post, that still won't be
			fast enough for an average computer to constantly render images at a good
			enough framerate, especially as the maximum iterations increase as you
			zoom deeper. <br /><br />

			To reduce the number of individual orbits we need to compute per render,
			we can use the result of 1 point to map to multiple. For example, the
			result of 1 pixel can be used to colour an entire 4x4 pixel square, so
			only 1/16th of the calculations have to be performed. This introduces a
			trade-off between quality and speed. In the case of real-time rendering so
			the user can move around the fractal it's more important there is a usable
			framerate, but for rendering final images/videos the quality should always
			be at the maximum, so this optimisation doesn't improve those render
			times.

			In order for the quality loss to not be completely detrimental, there are
			a number of tweaks you can perform. The first is to simply set a maximum
			'size' so the image will always be intelligible. Another tweak is to take
			note of the render time while an image is being rendered; if it takes too
			long and the frame would take too long for your minimum allowed fps,
			cancel and increase the size. If it takes a substantial amount less time,
			decrease the size. Finally, if the user stops moving, decrease the size
			rapidly (my approach was to halve the size each render so it would quickly
			but cleanly increase quality).

		<a href="#perturbation" class="heading" id="perturbation"
			>Perturbation Theory</a
		>
		<p class="main-content">
			Out of all the methods mentioned, perturbation is the most effective
			method to reduce render times (for deep zooms), albeit the most complex.
			It is the difference between a render taking minutes to milliseconds. This
			is because once we zoom in past the detail that double-precision floating
			point numbers can represent, we start having to use arbitrary precision
			floats which are a lot slower. In mathematics,
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory"
				target="_blank"
				>Perturbation theory</a
			>
			is defined as "finding an approximate solution to a problem by solving a
			related, similar problem". Perturbation is a relatively new area in
			fractal rendering, first becoming public in 2013 in
			<a
				href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408070057/http://superfractalthing.co.nf/sft_maths.pdf"
				target="_blank"
				>this paper</a
			>, and there are still new discussions and methods using perturbation
			theory as of writing this post. <br />
			<br />
			Perturbation theory works by selecting and computing one point of the
			render as the
			<b>reference orbit</b> at arbitrary precision, and using that orbit to
			calculate where the other points would be at each iteration with double
			precision, without having to iterate any other point (ideally). A short
			preview of the maths of how the other points are inferred from the
			reference orbit for the Mandelbrot set is shown here: <br />
			<br />
			reference orbit (note LHS is after, RHS is before)
			<br />
			<b>(1) z = z<sup>2</sup> + c</b>
			<br />
			orbit of point to infer
			<br />
			<b>(2) (z + dz) = (z + dz)<sup>2</sup> + (c + dc)</b>
			<br />
			expand (2)
			<br />
			<b>(z + dz) = (z<sup>2</sup> + 2*z*dz + dz<sup>2</sup>) + c + dc</b>
			<br />
			rearrange, and substitute the z in LHS with the definition of z from
			equation (1)
			<br />
			<b>
				(z<sup>2</sup> + c) + dz = (z<sup>2</sup> + c) + 2*z*dz + dz<sup>2</sup>
				+ dc
			</b>
			<br />
			we can now cancel z<sup>2</sup> + c
			<br />
			<b> dz = 2*z*dz + dz<sup>2</sup> + dc </b>
			<br />
			<br />
			This allows us to find the offset of the given point to the reference
			orbit for each iteration! As dz is super small, because when we zoom in
			the window we're viewing is super tiny, this can be calculated with double
			precision floating point numbers without the loss of precision (until
			5e305x magnification).

		<h3 class="subheading">Selecting the Reference Orbit</h3>
		<p class="main-content">
			Typically, the point for the reference orbit is taken from the centre of
			the screen. However, this means the whole image depends on a random point.
			If at any point the reference orbit escapes to infinity before reaching
			the maximum iterations, the orbits it took after that will either be too
			far away the other points won't be accurate, or it will be too large and
			just be represented as infinity. This means the image won't be accurate,
			as any points which need more iterations than the reference orbit will be
			considered as escaping at the same time as the reference orbit. There are
			a couple ways to resolve this issue, with some outlined here:
			<br />
			<br />
			1. Pre-selecting a known point in the Mandelbrot set to zoom in to, so
			regardless of the max iterations its orbit can always be used. This is
			good as it's the most simple approach, requiring no extra calculation.
			However, it's useless if you want to move around and explore the fractal,
			as the centre point must be fixed.
			<br />
			<br />
			2. Using new reference orbits for points that need more iterations,
			resulting in multiple reference orbits being used to calculate the full
			image. This is usually performed with rebasing, where you rebase to the
			new orbit (one that needs more iterations) and carry on from there. This
			is good as it's also simple to implement, and will result in an accurate
			final image. However, it is a relatively slow apporach as it will require
			you to do more computations with arbitrary precision numbers.
			<br />
			<br />
			3. Using a method to find the closest point that's in the set (or will
			require the most iterations) in the given window. This can be achieved
			with methods such as the
			<a
				href="http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/newtonraphsonmethod.html"
				target="_blank"
				>newton-raphson method</a
			>. This is good as, on the event of finding a point, the computed image
			will be very accurate. However, this is the most complicated to implement
			and requires a more calculations than some other methods. <br />
			<br />
			4. A new, faster rebasing. Instead of rebasing to a new reference orbit,
			<a
				href="https://fractalforums.org/fractal-mathematics-and-new-theories/28/another-solution-to-perturbation-glitches/4360"
				target="_blank"
				>it has been found</a
			>
			you can simply continue with the same reference orbit but reset the
			reference orbit back to 0 + 0i (the start) once it explodes to infinity,
			and carrying on from there (this should happen when calculaing the
			perturbed points, not the reference orbit, as there's not point
			re-calculating the reference orbit once it diverges). This requires no
			extra calculations, but still results in an accurate image. This solution
			is very new, only being found on fractalforums in
			<a

		<h3 class="subheading">Solving perturbation glitches</h3>
		<p class="main-content">
			Another issue with perturbation are glitches, which are areas which look
			very noisy or have areas of uniform colour. These were

			>
			, and happen when <b>|z| < |dz|</b>, the reason is because the perturbed
			orbit goes near 0 + 0i. To solve this, you either select a new reference
			orbit, or rebase (the same better rebasing can also be used in this
			instance).
